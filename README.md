#### _This project allows the user to input words or phrases, and COMPUTRON the mighty will inform them if their input is an anagram, an antigram, or niether_

#### By _**Reid Ashwill**_

## Description

_This a ruby app that runs in the terminal.  It allows the user to input two words, or phrases.  Those inputs are then ran through an algorithm which first checks if they are valid inputs (only words that contain a vowel, and are then ordered and compared against each other to determine if they are anagrams, antigrams, or niether._
